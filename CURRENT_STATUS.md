## ⚠️ Current Issue: Vercel 401 Error

The app is deployed to Vercel but returning a 401 error. This is likely due to:

1. **Team/Organization Settings**: Vercel may have domain protection enabled
2. **Privacy Settings**: The project might be set to private/team-only access
3. **Authentication Requirements**: Vercel SSO protection might be active

### Deployed URLs (currently blocked by 401)
- https://house-hunt-bens-projects-59237fe6.vercel.app
- https://house-hunt-c4uridjx7-bens-projects-59237fe6.vercel.app

## 🔧 How to Fix the 401 Issue

### Option 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select the `house-hunt` project
3. Go to Settings → Security
4. Check if "Password Protection" or "Vercel Authentication" is enabled
5. Disable any protection to make it publicly accessible

### Option 2: Redeploy to Personal Account
```bash
# Switch to personal account if needed
vercel switch

# Redeploy to personal account
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Use Custom Domain
Add a custom domain in Vercel settings to bypass team restrictions.

## 🚀 What Happens After Fixing 401

Once the 401 issue is resolved, your family will see:

### Landing Page
- Professional hero section with "House Hunt Platform"
- Feature overview (AI analysis, deal-breakers, family collaboration)

### After Authentication (with placeholder credentials)
