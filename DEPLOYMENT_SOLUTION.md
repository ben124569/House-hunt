## 🔍 Root Cause Identified: Private GitHub Repository

**Issue**: Vercel returns 401 Unauthorized for all deployments
**Root Cause**: Your GitHub repository is private, triggering Vercel's authentication restrictions
**Solution**: Make the repository public or use alternative deployment

## 🚀 Quick Fix Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Make GitHub Repository Public ⭐ **FASTEST**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ben124569/House-hunt
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"**
4. Click **"Change repository visibility"**
5. Select **"Make Public"**
6. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

**Result**: Instant access to your platform at the Vercel URL

### Option 2: Alternative Deployment Platforms
Deploy to platforms without private repo restrictions:

#### A) Netlify
```bash
npm run build
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

#### B) Railway
```bash
# Connect GitHub repo directly at railway.app
# Automatic deployment with zero config
```

#### C) Render
```bash
# Import repository at render.com
# Build: npm run build
# Start: npm start
```

### Option 3: Custom Domain on Vercel
