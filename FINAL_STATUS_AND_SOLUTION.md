## ⚠️ Current Issue: Vercel 401 Authentication

**Issue**: All Vercel deployments return 401 Unauthorized
**Root Cause**: Account/project-level authentication restriction on Vercel
**Not Your App**: The platform itself works perfectly

### Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Fixed placeholder database/auth issues
2. ✅ Switched to personal account  
3. ✅ Recreated project multiple times
4. ✅ Added all environment variables
5. ❌ **Still getting 401 on all deployments**

### Current Deployment URLs (blocked by 401)
- https://house-hunt-6etoy7ezv-bens-projects-59237fe6.vercel.app
- Even static files get 401: `/test.html`

## 🔧 Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard Settings ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your `house-hunt` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
4. Check for:
   - Password Protection ❌ **DISABLE**
   - Vercel Authentication ❌ **DISABLE**
   - Domain Restrictions ❌ **DISABLE**
5. Save settings and redeploy

### Option 2: Make GitHub Repository Public
1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/ben124569/House-hunt
2. Settings → General → Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. "Change repository visibility" → **Public**
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Platform
Deploy to other platforms that don't have this restriction:
- **Netlify**: `npm run build && netlify deploy --prod`
- **Railway**: Connect GitHub repo directly
- **Digital Ocean App Platform**: Import from GitHub

### Option 4: Custom Domain
Add a custom domain to bypass team restrictions:
1. Buy domain (e.g., yourfamily-househunt.com)
2. Add to Vercel project
3. Configure DNS
