# Suburb Intelligence System

A comprehensive suburb research platform for property investment decisions in Northern Adelaide, South Australia. This system gathers multi-source data to create evidence-based suburb profiles with safety assessments, market analysis, and investment recommendations.

## üéØ Purpose

This system was built specifically for family property research with these requirements:
- **Budget**: Under $900k
- **Location**: Northern Adelaide suburbs  
- **Deal Breakers**: Flood zones, 2-story houses, no car parking, no solar panels
- **Must Haves**: Single story, 2+ living areas, 2+ bathrooms, dog-friendly yard
- **Family**: Includes overseas family members needing comprehensive research

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Research a Single Suburb

```typescript
import { researchSuburb, generateIntelligenceSummary } from './suburb-intelligence';

// Research Angle Vale comprehensively
const data = await researchSuburb('Angle Vale', '5117');
const intelligence = generateIntelligenceSummary(data);

console.log(`Recommendation: ${intelligence.recommendation}`);
console.log(`Reasoning: ${intelligence.reasoning}`);
console.log(`Strengths: ${intelligence.strengths.join(', ')}`);
console.log(`Concerns: ${intelligence.concerns.join(', ')}`);
```

### Batch Compare Suburbs

```typescript
import { batchResearchSuburbs } from './suburb-intelligence';

const suburbs = [
  { name: 'Angle Vale', postcode: '5117' },
  { name: 'Smithfield Plains', postcode: '5114' },
  { name: 'Andrews Farm', postcode: '5114' },
];

const results = await batchResearchSuburbs(suburbs);
// Compare results for decision making
```

### Check Flood Risk (Critical!)

```typescript
import { isHighFloodRiskSuburb } from './suburb-intelligence';

## üö´ Important Limitations

### Current Implementation Status
This is a **framework and data structure** - the actual web scraping and API integrations are **not yet fully implemented**. Current system provides:

‚úÖ **Implemented**:
- Complete data structure and schemas
- Static coordinates for all Northern Adelaide suburbs  
- Quality assessment and validation framework
- Intelligence scoring and recommendation engine
- Database integration via tRPC
- Deal breaker detection (especially flood risk)

üöß **Not Yet Implemented**:
- Live web scraping of government websites
- API integrations with property portals
- Real-time crime statistics collection  
- Automated school data gathering
- Live market price updates
- Development application monitoring

### Data Collection Requirements
To make this system fully operational, you would need to implement:

1. **Web Scraping**: Safe, respectful scraping of government websites
2. **API Integrations**: Property portal APIs (RealEstate.com.au, Domain)
3. **Data Processing**: Parse and clean scraped data
4. **Caching**: Implement proper caching for expensive API calls
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for data collection failures

## üîß Integration with tRPC

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing tRPC setup:

### New tRPC Endpoints
```typescript
// Research a single suburb  
api.suburb.research.useMutation()

// Batch research multiple suburbs
api.suburb.batchResearch.useMutation()  

// Get Northern Adelaide overview
api.suburb.getNorthernAdelaideOverview.useQuery()

// Get suburbs needing refresh
api.suburb.getStaleSuburbs.useQuery()
```

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- `getByName`: Now includes intelligence summaries
- `getById`: Enhanced with quality scores  
- `list`: Adds research status and confidence levels
- `compare`: Intelligence-powered suburb comparison

## ü§ù Usage in Property Research Workflow

### For Property Listing Analysis
```typescript
// When adding a new property from RealEstate.com.au
const property = await addProperty(listingUrl);
const suburb = await api.suburb.getOrCreate.mutate({
  name: property.suburb,
  postcode: property.postcode  
});

// Automatically check deal breakers
if (suburb.isHighFloodRisk) {
  markPropertyAsRejected(property.id, 'High flood risk - deal breaker');
}
```

### For Family Decision Making
```typescript
// Generate family-friendly comparison report
const suburbs = await api.suburb.compare.useQuery({
  suburbIds: selectedSuburbIds
});

const dealBreakers = suburbs.comparison.dealBreakers;
const recommendations = suburbs.comparison.recommendations;

// Share with overseas family
generateFamilyReport(suburbs, dealBreakers, recommendations);
```

This suburb intelligence system provides the comprehensive, evidence-based research platform needed for confident property investment decisions while automatically flagging deal breakers and highlighting opportunities.
