   ```bash
   vercel env add DATABASE_URL
   # Paste your connection string when prompted
   ```

### 2. Authentication Setup (Google OAuth)

   vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   # Paste the generated secret
   
   vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL
   # Enter: https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
   ```

### 4. Deploy with Environment Variables
