import { researchSuburb, generateIntelligenceSummary } from './src/lib/research/suburb-intelligence';

// Research Angle Vale
const data = await researchSuburb('Angle Vale', '5117');
const intelligence = generateIntelligenceSummary(data);

console.log(`Recommendation: ${intelligence.recommendation}`);
console.log(`Flood Risk: ${data.riskAssessment?.floodRisk?.level}`);
// Output: Recommendation: avoid, Flood Risk: HIGH
```

### Batch Compare Suburbs
```typescript
import { batchResearchSuburbs } from './src/lib/research/suburb-intelligence';

const suburbs = [
  { name: 'Andrews Farm', postcode: '5114' },
  { name: 'Gawler East', postcode: '5118' },
];

const results = await batchResearchSuburbs(suburbs);
// Compare results for family decision making
```

### Check Flood Risk (Critical!)
```typescript
import { isHighFloodRiskSuburb } from './src/lib/research/suburb-intelligence';

if (isHighFloodRiskSuburb('Angle Vale')) {
  console.log('‚ùå AVOID: High flood risk area');
}
// Automatic deal breaker detection
```

## üìä Sample Output

### Intelligence Summary Example
```json
{
  "recommendation": "avoid",
  "reasoning": "High flood risk areas are a deal breaker for this family purchase",
  "strengths": ["Good transport links", "Growing area"],
